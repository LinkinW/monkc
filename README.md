## Overview

**Monk-C**, is a toolkit for OOP programming use pure C (static library). the aim of Monk-C is to support OOP in pure C with some tiny C macros, functions and even a light preprocessor. Monk-C is inspired by Apple Objective-C and gcc builtin "Constructing Calls". It is tiny and primitive but full of fun. I use it to play with my RaspberryPi and it really vary suitable for the ARM/Linux based embeded systems. It is open source under **BSD** license(3-clause license). I written it under the X86/Linux platform and X86/MacOS ARM/Linux is also fully tested and supportted both 32bit and 64bit.

###### Monk-C is based on **C99** standard

###### No stable version released now, developing commit: 0.1.140223

#### need these tools:
    gmake - this is needed on FreeBSD
            i am trying to write a generic makefile for both
            make and GNU make. but for now. please alias your
            make to gmake.
	clang - I strongly recommand use this C compiler. 
	        because i found it can report more detailed error infomations
	flex - this is needed to build the 'mcpp' preprocessor for monkc

#### recomand code editor:
	Sublime Text 
	(you can use any editor. but some one have auto-complete function will help a lot)

#### IDE support (template project):

	all templete project in /IDESupport folder
	here is the IDEs:
	1. Xcode   			(MacOS)
	2. Eclipse 			(Linux/Windows)
	3. VisualStudio12 	(Windows)

#### how to compile and install (command line):

	0. default is compile by 'clang'. make sure you have one installed. 
	   it also need 'flex'. you can install flex by 'sudo apt-get install flex' on Ubuntu
	   or install flex use macport on Mac OS X
	1. cd ./src
	2. sudo make install

	clang is recommand. cause it can output better error infomations
	if you want change it to gcc
	change [ CC = clang -> CC = gcc ] in:
	1. /src/monkc_runtime/Makefile 	    -> line10 
	2. /src/monkc_buildtool/mcbuild     -> line12
	3. /src/lemontea/Makefile			-> line9
	4. /src/tests/Makefile				-> line7
	to use gcc as the compiler

	the command above will build the <libmonkc.a> <liblemontea.a>
	and automatically copy them to 				/usr/local/lib/
	and copy the <.h> header files to 			/usr/local/include/
	and copy the <mcpp> <mcbuild> tool to 		/usr/local/bin/

#### how to create and build a monkc project:

	1. mkdir <your project dir>
	2. cd <your project dir> && mcbuild -create
	3. write code in the <your project dir/src> folder
	  (you can use any folder structure to organize your code)
	4. cd <your project dir> && mcbuild -build
	5. the output binary will be 'exec' in the project root dir
	  (see the examples folder for more details)

## Syntax
**Monk-C** use "MC" as the prefix.
#### main entry

	int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
	{
		LOG_LEVEL = MC_VERBOSE;
		//your code here
		return 0;
	}

	global log level:
	you can set the global variable LOG_LEVEL to:
	MC_SILENT		//no log outputed
	MC_ERROR_ONLY  //error log only
	MC_DEBUG 		//error log and debug log
	MC_VERBOSE     //error log and debug log and runtime log

	you can use:
	error_log()
	debug_log()
	runtime_log()
	to output logs. parameter is same as printf(char* fmt, ...)

#### declear interface - write in .h file

	#include "monkc.h" ---> must include (can be global setted use "-include" option of compiler)
	#include "BirdFather.h"	 ---> super class

	#ifndef Bird_ ---> avoid multi-defines (can be auto generated by IDE)
	#define Bird_

	implements(Flyable); ---> optional protocol mark (do nothing just a mark)
	extends(BirdFather); ---> optional super class mark (do nothing just a mark)

	monkc(Bird); ---> class data begin
		char* name;
		int type;
	end(Bird); ---> class data end

	method(Bird, void, bye, xxx); ---> class public method list begin
	method(Bird, Bird*, initWithType, int type);
	method(Bird, void, fly, xxx);
	method(Bird, int, fatherAge, xxx); ---> class public method list end

	#endif ---> avoid multi-defines
	
#### implement methods - write in .c file
		
	#include "Bird.h"

	initer(Bird) ---> must have. initialize the class data
	{
		obj->super = new(BirdFather); ---> new your super by hand!
		obj->type = 3;
		debug_logt("Bird", "[%p] init called\n", obj);
		return obj;
	}

	method(Bird, void, bye, xxx) ---> 1.public method implements
	{
		debug_logt(nameof(obj), "[%p] bye called\n", obj);
		recycle(obj->super);
	}

	static void funcA(Bird* obj, int arg1) ---> 2.private C function
	{
		debug_log("i am local function A\n");
	}

	protocol(Flyable, void, duckFly, xxx) ---> 3.protocol method you comply with
	{
		debug_log("%s\n", "Bird:Duck GuaGuaGua fly");
	}

	protocol(Flyable, void, chickenFly, xxx)		
	{
		debug_log("%s\n", "Bird:Chicken JiJiJi fly");
	}

	method(Bird, Bird*, initWithType, int type)
	{
		obj->type = type;
		return obj;
	}

	method(Bird, int, fatherAge, xxx)
	{
		int fage = cast(BirdFather, obj->super)->age;
		debug_logt(nameof(obj), "my father age is: %d\n", fage);
		return fage;
	}

	method(Bird, void, fly, xxx)
	{
		debug_log("Bird[%p->%p]: default fly type %d\n", obj, obj->super, obj->type);
		funcA(obj, 100);
	}

	loader(Bird) ---> must have. binding methods at runtime.
	{
		debug_logt(nameofc(class), "load called\n");
		#include "Flyable.p" ---> protocol itself is just a header file

		//DO NOT WRITE THEM BY HAND!
		//YOU CAN COPY ALL THE METHODS DECLEARED IN HEADER FILE
		//AND CHANGE "method->binding"
		binding(Bird, Bird*, initWithType, int type);
		binding(Bird, void, bye, xxx);
		binding(Bird, void, fly, xxx);
		binding(Bird, int, fatherAge, xxx);
		return claz;
	}

####Dynamically calling method

	it just like the Objective-C. sending message instead of function call.

	Bird* bird = new(Bird);
	ff(bird, fly, nil);

####Statically calling method
	
	C style: 	Bird_fly(bird, 0, fly, nil);
	Macro:		call(bird, Bird, fly, nil);

####Macros and runtime functions often used

####protocol file

	Flyable.p:

	binding(Flyable, void, duckFly, xxx);
	binding(Flyable, void, chickenFly, xxx);


######the BIND part (include in .c file):

	loader(Bird)
	{
		debug_logt(class->name, "load called\n");
		#include "Flyable.p"

		binding(Bird, Bird*, initWithType, int type);
		binding(Bird, void, bye, xxx);
		binding(Bird, void, fly, xxx);
		binding(Bird, int, fatherAge, xxx);
		return claz;
	}

####TODO list:

	1. add type convert to preprocessor mcpp

	2. add auto binding to preprocessor mcpp

	3. add arg type check to preprocessor mcpp

	4. lemontea_WEB

	5. lemontea_GUI

	6. lemontea_3D
