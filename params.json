Monk-C is inspired by Apple Objective-C and gcc builtin \"Constructing Calls\". It is tiny and primitive but full of fun. I use it to play with my RaspberryPi and it really vary suitable for the ARM/Linux based embeded systems. It is open source under **BSD** license(3-clause license). I written it under the X86/Linux platform and X86/MacOS ARM/Linux is also fully tested and supportted both 32bit and 64bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
